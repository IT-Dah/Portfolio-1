          <p>
            Rainydays was the first webpage i ever created. It was a school project where we were supposed to create a webpage for a fictional company. I chose to create a webpage for a company that sells rainwear. The webpage is created with HTML and CSS. It has a clean design, but still needs some work when it comes to HTML, CSS and responsiveness. The webpage is not connected to a database, so the content is static.

          <p>Created a webpage for an interactive science museum called "Wonder Sphere". Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. <br> The webpage is not connected to a database, so the content is static.

          <p>We got a chance to demonstrate our ability to interpret a brief, plan our solution, design a user interface, and build and test a responsive web application. We were required to use all of the skills that we have learned during our first year at school, including design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          I created a blogpage for a gamer, called Pixl Ponder.
          <br> This page is up and running at: <a href="https://norofffeu.github.io/FED1-PE1-IT-Dah/">https://norofffeu.github.io/FED1-PE1-IT-Dah/</a>
