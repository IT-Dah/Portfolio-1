Plan:

- Find inspiration for my portfolio.
- Create wireframes and a full design in figma.
- Build up HTML, CSS and JS, to create a responsive and customer-friendly portfolio.

Acknowledgments:

The lack of time and inspiration has made this task incredible hard for me.
I have unfinished projects from earlier this year, and no time to update or finish them. I do not wish to have unfinished work in my portfolio.
Therefore i will have to keep working on this portfolio over the summer.
